(** [TheName s] introduces a name strictly (there can't be another one with the same name in the context).
    [FreshFrom x] uses [get_binder_name x] to generate a name, and then ensures it's fresh.
                  If [get_binder_name] fails, it generates a new name (Never fails).
    [FreshFromStr s] takes string s and generates a fresh name.
    [Generate] Generates a fresh name.
